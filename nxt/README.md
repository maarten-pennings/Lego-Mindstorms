# LEGO NXT

Hints, tips, and tricks for the LEGO NXT Mindstorms robotics system.

## Getting started

- **Install**  
  On Windows 10 PC, the IDE from LEGO does not always install.
  See [install](install/install.md) for some installation tips, 
  extra resources (images), and resetting a clicking brick.
  For the install on the LEGO club, see below.
  
- **IDE**  
  NXT-G is the IDE (integrated development environment) of LEGO Mindstorms NXT.
  It does have its quirks. See [ide](ide/ide.md) for some tips.

- **Blocks**  
  The NXT-G IDE comes with several "blocks" (subroutines, library functions), but you can also make your own.
  See [blocks](blocks/blocks.md) for some tips.

- **Repair**
  The NXT starts to be old, showing failing components, see [repair](repairs/readme.md)
  for hardware repair hints.
  

## Projects

- **Elevator**  
  Made for the LEGO club; only [code](legoclub/elevator/readme.md).

- **Simon**  
  The _Simon says_ game, no documentation, only [code](simon).

- **LEGO club**  
  I run a LEGO club in the village, were 8-12 year old children make robots using LEGO Mindstorms NXT.
  The exercises of the [LEGOclub](legoclub) are in Dutch only.
